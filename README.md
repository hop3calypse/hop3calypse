# Hey! I'm Hugo 🍃

Welcome on my profile! I'm mainly interested in **cybersecurity** and **AI**.\
I want to be able to contribute to ideas and innovative projects that inspire people, just like others inspire me.

I'm an active member of these associations:
* [@PoCInnovation](https://github.com/PoCInnovation), in the cybersecurity team. Currently working on the [Pathwar project](https://github.com/pathwar/pathwar).
* [@E-mma](https://github.com/E-mma), where I help people learn computer science through diverse events.
